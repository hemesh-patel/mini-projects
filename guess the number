'''
The Goal: Similar to the first project, this project also uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a 
number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.)
If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). 
If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, 
to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.

import random

x = random.randrange(0, 10)
while True:
    number = raw_input('Enter a number:\n')
    if int(number) > x:
        print 'Your number is too high'
        continue
    elif int(number) < x:
        print 'Your number is too low'
        continue
    elif int(number) == x:
        print 'Well done Mahi, you guessed it right!'
        exit()
