1. Dice Rolling Simulator

The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will 
randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.) The 
program will print what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll need to set the min 
and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function 
that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

def roll():
    while True:
        yes_no = raw_input('Would you like to roll the die?\n')
        if yes_no == 'yes' or yes_no == 'Yes' or yes_no == 'y' or yes_no == 'Y' or yes_no == 'YES':
            print random.randrange(1, 7)
        elif yes_no == 'no' or yes_no == 'No' or yes_no == 'N' or yes_no == 'n' or yes_no == 'NO':
            exit()
        elif yes_no != 'yes' or yes_no != 'Yes' or yes_no != 'y' or yes_no != 'Y' or yes_no == 'YES':
            while yes_no != 'yes' or yes_no != 'Yes' or yes_no != 'y' or yes_no != 'Y' or yes_no == 'YES':
                print 'Please enter yes or no'
                break
roll()
